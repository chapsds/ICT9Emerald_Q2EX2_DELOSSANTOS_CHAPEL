		<p>The Moral Man and The "Good Man's" similarities and differences. I see both of them as people that spread goodness around people. Both issue respect and dignity. Tho they are both similar when it comes to "goodness". A good man doesn't always mean a moral man. A moral man devotes his/her life to a religion, avoiding sin as much as possible because he fears God, which makes some of them hated by society. The so called "good man" can still sin with no remorse. So the crucial difference both have are their hearts. Not all good men are moral men but all moral men are good men. </p>

		<h2>Topic 2</h2>
		<p>How to become a moral man. Moral people are people who surrender or submit their people to a God. In my case its Christianity. Its fairly easy to submit your life to Christ. You can submit with one word, faith. To prove what Im saying is accurate even in scriptures. Ephesians 2:1-10 supports my claim. No matter how much works you do for God. You can never redeem the evil that this world has created. You are only saved through the faith of Jesus Christ. That is why he died on the cross for us. He was the ultimate sin sacrifice. It is the reason why we have a chance to enter the kingdom of God or heaven.</p>
